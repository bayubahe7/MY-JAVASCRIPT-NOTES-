<h3>How Your Recipe Looks and Test-like after Preparation</h3>
  <p>
    When properly prepared, fried rice should have a light golden-brown color with vibrant vegetables and well-cooked proteins. It should emit a savory, slightly sweet, and umami aroma with hints of garlic and onions. The taste should be a balanced mix of savory, umami, slight sweetness, and well-seasoned flavors, complemented by a subtle garlicky and oniony undertone. The texture should feature separate, non-clumpy rice grains, crunchy vegetables, tender proteins, and fluffy scrambled eggs. Overall, it should be visually appealing, aromatic, and deliciously balanced in flavor and texture.
