  <!--A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
  A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).-->
  <script>
    //JavaScript Function Syntax
    function name (parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
                  // code to be executed
                 }
      //Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

       //Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked. 
      //Function Return:When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
      // Function is called, the return value will end up in x
          let x = myFunction(4, 3);

          function myFunction(a, b) {
          // Function returns the product of a and b
            return a * b;
          }
       console.log(x);
      /*
        Why Functions?

        With functions you can reuse code

        You can write code that can be used many times.

        You can use the same code with different arguments, to produce different results.

      */

  <script>
    //The () Operator invokes (calls)the function:
    //example
    function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
                return (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32);
              }

    let value = toCelsius(77);
    console.log(`${value} Celsius Degree!`);

    //note that Accessing a function without () returns the function and not the function result:

    //example
    let degree = toCelsius(77);
    function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
                return (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32);
              }

    let valued = toCelsius;
    console.log(valued);

    /*
    the above code will function instead of functiom result because we called the function without brackets.
    */
   /*
   Note:
   As you see from the examples above, toCelsius refers to the function object, and toCelsius() refers to the function result.
   */

  </script>
  <script>
    //Functions Used as Variable Values
    /*
    Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.
    */
   //Example:
   //Instead of using a variable to store the return value of a function:
   let y = toCelsius(77);
   let text = "The temperature is " + y + " Celsius";

   //from above example You can use the function directly, as a variable value:
   //let text = "The temperature is " + toCelsius(77) + " Celsius";
   //in above code we commented you can see that the function substituted y.

   //Local Variables:
   //Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
   //Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
   //example:

   // code here can NOT use carName

function myFunction() {
  let carName = "Volvo";
  // code here CAN use carName
    }

  // code here can NOT use carName
   /*
   Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.

    Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.
  */
  </script>

  <script>
    //Example
    // Function to compute the product of p1 and p2
      /*function myFunction(p1, p2) {
        let product = p1 * p2;
        return product;
      }
      */
      //or you can write above code as follows and will work the same as the above codes:
      
      /*function myFunction (p1,p2){
        return p1*p2;
      }
      */
//similarly it works as this arrow function below
      myFunction = (p1,p2) =>{
        return p1*p2;
      }

    //below i'm going to call above function and passing argument to it!
  
    console.log(myFunction(2,77));
    console.log(myFunction(3,45));
    //the above function will print out the product in the console
    // in this way you can call the function many times you want with different arguments.

  </script>

  <script>
    //Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:
//let myFunction = (a, b) => a * b;
//before arrow: 


    //this before arrow function:
hello = function() {
  return "Hello World!";
}

//With Arrow Function:

hello = () => {
  return "Hello World!";
}

/*
It gets shorter! If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, you can remove the brackets and the return keyword:
*/

//Arrow Functions Return Value by Default:

hello = () => "Hello World!";

//Note: This works only if the function has only one statement. so if not use return and brackets for your arrow fx.

//If you have parameters, you pass them inside the parentheses:
//Arrow Function With Parameters:
hello = (val) => "Hello " + val;

//In fact, if you have only one parameter, you can skip the parentheses as well:
//Arrow Function Without Parentheses:
hello = val => "Hello " + val;
